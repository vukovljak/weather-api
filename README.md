# weather-api
Simple Weather App
For this project I used API from https://openweathermap.org/api .
On the Home Page you can see live weather informations about three cities - Belgrade, Bozeman(US) and Chicago.
You can also search for particular place in the Search Box.
Search Box can call the functions from Java Script by ckicking key Enter or from the click on the icon.

Once it display informations about place, you can also see weather gif for particular weather contition. For example, if it's raining - there'll be a gif for Rain..etc.
